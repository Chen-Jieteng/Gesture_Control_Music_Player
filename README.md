# Gesture-Control MP3 Music Player
Gesture-Controlled Music Player using Arduino UNO R4 WIFI (without bluetooth)

# Overview
This Arduino-based project combines hardware interaction with intuitive software to create a user-friendly music playing experience. Utilizing the PAJ7620 gesture sensor and the LX-MP3 music player module, this setup allows users to control music playback with simple hand gestures.

# Features
## Play/Pause: 
Wave your hand up to pause the current track, and down to play or resume playback.
## Track Navigation: 
Swipe left to play the previous track, and right to skip to the next one.
## Volume Control: 
(Optional feature you can describe if applicable, e.g., circle clockwise to increase and counterclockwise to decrease volume.)
## Low Power Consumption: 
Optimized for energy efficiency, suitable for battery-powered setups.
## Easy Integration: 
Designed to be easily integrated into other projects or standalone use.

# Hardware Components
## Arduino UNO R4 WIFI: 
Serves as the central processing unit to interpret gestures and control music playback.
## PAJ7620 Gesture Sensor: 
Detects hand gestures made by the user.
## LX-MP3 Music Player Module: 
Plays the music tracks stored on an external SD card.
## General Connections: 
Utilizes digital pins for gesture sensing and music control, ensuring a modular and extendable design.

# Software
The software for this project is written in Arduino IDE, leveraging libraries for the PAJ7620 sensor to accurately detect gestures. The code handles initialization, gesture recognition, and controls the music player module according to the user's hand movements.
